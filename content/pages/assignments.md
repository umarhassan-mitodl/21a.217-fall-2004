There are two assignments for this course: one short paper and one longer paper. The short paper will be on readings in the first third of the class. The longer paper will be on a topic, chosen by the student in consultation with the instructor, related to the War on Terror or the invasion of Iraq. There will be a brief class presentation preceding the longer paper.

First Paper
-----------

Write 5-7 double-spaced pages (due two days after Lecture 10) on ONE of the following topics:

1.  Do you agree with William James that there can be a "moral equivalent of war"? Bring other readings into your discussion.
2.  The Ilongot told Renato Rosaldo that Western warfare is immoral compared to their own. Based on the reading you have done for this class, how would you evaluate this statement.
3.  How would you evaluate the sociobiologists' case that war is genetically programmed into human nature?
4.  How much culpability does the West have for the genocide in Rwanda? What (if anything) could the West have done to prevent it? Be sure to refer in your answer to the Rwandan dynamics of the genocide as well.
